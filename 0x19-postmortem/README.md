## Issue Summary
**Duration**: February 28, 2025, 13:00 - 15:30 (UTC-5)
**Impact**: The navigation menu on our web app stopped working for approximately 70% of users, specifically those using mobile devices. Users couldn’t access key sections of the site (like their dashboard and profile) via the hamburger menu, leading to frustration and increased support tickets.
**Root Cause**: A faulty JavaScript event listener introduced during a refactor of the navigation component, causing click events to not register on mobile devices.

##Timeline
13:00 – Issue detected via customer support complaints about the mobile menu not opening.
13:10 – Frontend engineer confirmed the issue on mobile devices.
13:20 – Initial assumption: CSS media queries were broken after a recent styling update.
13:40 – CSS thoroughly checked with no anomalies found.
14:00 – Misleading path: Focus shifted to caching issues; cache was purged, but the problem persisted.
14:20 – Escalated to the team lead for deeper code review.
14:45 – Found that a recent JavaScript refactor replaced addEventListener('click', ...) with a custom hook, which failed to bind on touch devices.
15:00 – Rolled back the problematic deployment.
15:30 – Menu functionality restored and verified on multiple devices.

## Root Cause and Resolution
### Root Cause
During a code refactor to optimize reusable components, the navigation menu's event listener was switched to a new custom React hook for handling clicks. However, the hook did not properly account for mobile-specific touch events (like touchstart), causing clicks on the hamburger icon to be ignored on mobile browsers.

### Resolution
We rolled back to the previous stable release, which restored the working event listener. After rollback, a patch was prepared to fix the custom hook, adding full support for both click and touch events, and this was redeployed after thorough testing.

## Corrective and Preventative Measures
### Improvements/Fixes
- Improve testing coverage for key user interactions, particularly on mobile devices.
- Implement device-based QA checks as part of the deployment process.
- Review all custom hooks to ensure they handle cross-device compatibility.
## Tasks
- Write end-to-end tests covering navigation menu interactions on desktop and mobile.
- Add mobile testing to the CI pipeline with device emulation.
- Document best practices for writing cross-device compatible event handlers.
- Perform a full audit of other interactive components that use the same custom hook.
- Improve rollback procedures to make them faster in the event of frontend regressions.
